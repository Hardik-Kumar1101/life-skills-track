**Question 1
*What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?
 
*Answer 
1. Give your full attention: When someone is speaking to you, focus on them completely. Put away distractions like phones or other devices, maintain eye contact, and give verbal or non-verbal cues to show you are attentive.

2. Be genuinely interested: Approach the conversation with an open mind and a sincere desire to understand the speaker's perspective. Avoid preconceived notions or judgments.

3. Show empathy and respect: Acknowledge the speaker's feelings and emotions, even if you don't agree with their viewpoint. Respect their right to express themselves and avoid interrupting or imposing your opinions.

4. Use verbal and non-verbal cues: Nodding, smiling, and using encouraging words like "I see," "Go on," or "Tell me more" can signal that you are actively listening and encourage the speaker to share further.

5. Paraphrase and summarize: Periodically rephrase or summarize what the speaker has said to confirm your understanding and let them know you are actively engaged in the conversation


**Question 2
*According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?

*Answer
Fisher's model of Reflective Listening is part of the Structured Communication Training (SCT) approach developed by Roger Fisher and his colleagues. It is designed to improve communication and understanding between individuals, particularly in conflict resolution and negotiation settings. The key points of Reflective Listening according to Fisher's model are as follows:

1. Repeating back content: Reflective Listening involves paraphrasing or repeating back the content of the speaker's message in your own words. This demonstrates that you are actively processing and understanding what the speaker is saying.

2. Checking for accuracy: After repeating back the content, the listener should check with the speaker to ensure that the interpretation is accurate. This step helps to clarify any misunderstandings and shows that you genuinely want to comprehend the speaker's perspective.

3. Identifying and acknowledging emotions: Reflective Listening goes beyond merely understanding the factual content. It also involves identifying and acknowledging the emotions expressed by the speaker. This can be done by recognizing and reflecting on the feelings behind the words.

4. Validating the speaker's emotions: Validation means showing empathy and understanding towards the speaker's emotions, even if you don't necessarily agree with their point of view. Validating emotions helps create a supportive and non-judgmental environment for communication.

5. Being non-judgmental: In Reflective Listening, the listener avoids passing judgment or giving unsolicited advice. The focus is on understanding and acknowledging the speaker's perspective without imposing one's opinions.


**Question 3
*What are the obstacles in your listening process?

*Answer
1. Distractions: External distractions like noise, interruptions, or a busy environment can make it difficult to concentrate on the speaker's message.

2. Preoccupation: When the listener is preoccupied with their own thoughts, worries, or concerns, it can be challenging to give their full attention to the speaker.

3. Biases and judgments: Preconceived opinions or biases can cloud the listener's ability to be open and objective during the conversation.

4. Selective listening: Sometimes, people tend to focus only on the parts of the message that align with their interests or beliefs, ignoring other relevant information.

5. Emotional triggers: Strong emotions can interfere with effective listening, especially if the topic being discussed is sensitive or personal.


**Question 4
*What can you do to improve your listening?

*Answer
1. Give your full attention: When someone is speaking to you, be present and focus solely on the speaker. Avoid distractions and give them your undivided attention.

2. Maintain eye contact: Making eye contact shows the speaker that you are engaged and interested in what they are saying.

3. Avoid interrupting: Let the speaker finish their thoughts before responding. Interrupting can disrupt the flow of conversation and make the speaker feel unheard.

4. Practice active listening: Actively engage with the speaker's words and content. Use verbal cues like nodding, verbal affirmations ("I see," "Sure," "Interesting"), and paraphrasing to show you are actively processing their message.

5. *Avoid distractions*: Find a quiet and comfortable environment for the conversation, especially for important or sensitive discussions.
